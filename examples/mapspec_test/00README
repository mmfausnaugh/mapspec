These are data from the 2014 MDM reverberation mapping campaign.
Included are 3 spectra from two nights: 2014 01 10 (UT) was
photometric, 2014 04 17 was cloudy and requires significant rescaling.

Also included is a reference, ref.smooth.txt.  This was constructed by
averaging observations on photometric nights, then smoothing so that
FWHM of the [OIII]lambda5007 line matches that of the worst epoch.

There is also a sample window file, oiii.window (for 5007 angstroms,
observed frame).

To test mapspec.py, try

bash ../../run_map.py

It will start printing the spectrum name, then the iteration number,
best chi^2, and current chi^2.  You'll get several output files as
well--- scale_mcg0811_NNN_YYMMDD.txt and
scale.h._mcg0811_NNN_YYMMDD.txt which are the rescaling with a
Gaussian kernel and Gauss-Hermite Kernel, respectively.  You calso get
the MCMC chains (posterior parameter distribution) and
'mapspec.params', which keeps a list of the best-fit parameterse.
