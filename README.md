# mapspec #

`mapspec` stands for **M**cmc **A**lgorithm for **P**arameters of **SPEC**tra.  It was originally designed to rescale astronomical spectra to a standard flux scale, using a method similar to that of [van Groningen & Wanders 1992](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992PASP..104..700V).  Full details of the method are in [Fausnaugh 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04014), accepted for publication in PASP (please cite this paper if you use the code).  Along the way, several spectra analysis tools useful for dealing with bright/broad emission lines have been implemented.

# Installation and Dependencies#

`mapspec` is a fairly simple python package---just download it (best to use `git clone`) and put it in your python installation, your PYTHONPATH, or working directory.

You will also need the following python packages installed:

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib (for using built-in plotting functions)
* astropy (for reading and writting fits files)

Note that the code is in python 2.7---updating to python 3 is the first item on the to-do list.

To test the installation, go to `examples` and try running the test scripts:

    python test_sincinterp.py
    python test_linefit.py

These mostly deal with data structures in `spectrum.py`; to test the rescaling procedure itself, go to `mapspec_test` and run

   `bash ../../run_map.sh`

# Quick Start #

If you want to get right into it, the shell script `run_map.sh` gives a basic command for aligning spectra.  However, if you are wary of black boxes, skip to the 'Outline' (below).

Comments inside `run_map.sh` parse all arguments of this command, but for completeness, here are the data files that you need:

* A reference spectrum in 3 column ascii format (wavelength, flux, and flux error)
* A file with wavelength regions for the emission line.  This should be 3 lines: 1)  the wavelength window of the emission line, 2) the wavelength window of the blueward continuum, and 3) the wavelength window of the redward continuum.  Each line has 2 numbers: the blue edge of the wavelength window and the red edge of the wavelength window
* A list of files with spectra to rescale, 1 file per line.  Like the reference, the spectra should be in 3 column ascii format

Examples of all of these files are in `examples/mapspec_test`.

The actual work is done by a `python` script called `do_map.py`, which runs a list of spectra through the rescaling model.  This is the normal _modus operandi_ for reverberation mapping studies, so `do_map.py` might be adequate for most users.  The output (using the Gauss-Hermite smoothing kernel) will be saved in files called 'scale.h._input_spectrum_name'.

It is probably useful to learn how `do_map.py` works---the script may not be perfect for your requirements, and `do_map.py` also does some simple model comparisons (Gaussian smoothing vs. Gauss-Hermite smoothing).   The file `mapspec.params` compares the fits from different different rescaling procedures, and two output spectra are saved by default ('scale_input_spectrum_name' for Gaussian smoothing and  'scale.h._input_spectrum_name' for Gauss-Hermite smoothing).

# Outline #

`mapsec` is object-oriented and is designed to be modular and highly extensible.  It makes heavy use of numpy and scipy libraries, and was designed to easily integrate with these packages.

There are two main parts of the program:  First, general-usage spectrum utilities, which are bundled in `spectrum.py`.  Second, the rescaling procedure, which is kept in `mapspec.py`.  

Some helpful scripts for constructing a reference spectrum are also provided----these are `ref_make.py` and `ref_smooth.py`, check the internal comments for details.

We begin by describing (with illustrative examples) the spectrum utilities.

* * *

## Spectrum ##

The primary object is the `Spectrum` class.  `Spectrum` has 3 fundamental attributes:  wavelength (`Spectrum.wv`), flux  (`Spectrum.f`), and flux error (or measurement error, `Spectrum.ef`).  Each attribute is a numpy array, so all the functionality of numpy/scipy is preserved.  For example, to get the mean flux-level:

    from mapspec.spectrum import Spectrum
    my_spec = Spectrum()
    print my_spec.f.mean()

or to get the number of pixels:

    print my_spec.wv.size

(to actually put data in the `Spectrum` object, see "Reading Data" below).  `Spectrum` also has many useful methods to interpolate, rebin, extinction-correct, and smooth (or log-smooth) the data.  For example, this will rebin the spectrum to twice the original wavelength spacing:

    import numpy as np
    dx = my_spec.wv[1] - my_spec.wv[0] #assumes even wavelength spacing throughout
    xnew = np.arange(my_spec.wv.min(), my_spec.wv.max() + 2.*dx, 2.*dx)
    my_spec.rebin(xnew)



* * *

## Emission Lines ##

The next object is the `EmissionLine` class.  `EmissionLine` inherits from `Spectrum`, so it can be used in approximately the same way.  To instantiate an `EmissionLine`, you need to specify the line window and surrounding continuum:

    from mapspec.spectrum import EmissionLine
    oiii = [ [5065, 5115],     #OIII 5007, at redshift 1.018
             [5059, 5065],     #blue continuum
             [5115, 5129]  ]   # red continuum
    my_line = EmissionLine(my_spec, oiii[0], [oiii[1],oiii[2]] )

At instantization, `EmissionLine` fits a linear model to the local continuum (`oiii[1]` and `oiii[2]`) and subtracts the model underneath the emission line.  That is, `my_line.wv` is the wavelengths of `my_spec` between `oiii[0,0]` and `oiii[0,1]` and `my_line.f` is the corresponding section of `my_spec.f` minus the continuum fit.

`EmissionLine` also has other useful methods, such as `my_line.integrate_line()`, which will use `scipy.integrate.simps` to return the total line flux, or `my_line.fwhm()`, which will return the full-width-at-half-maximum of the line.

* * *

## Line Model ##

The last class is `LineModel`.  At instantization, `LineModel` fits a function to an input `EmissionLine`:

    from mapspec.spectrum import LineModel
    my_lmodel = LineModel(my_line, func='gauss-hermite')

The _raison d'Ãªtre_ of `LineModel` is to generate flux predictions at arbitrary wavelengths.  This is accomplished by overloading the class's call method, so you can think of `LineModel` as a kind of function:

    xeval = np.linspace( my_line.wv.min(), my_line.wv.max(), 500 )
    fpredict = my_lmodel(xeval)

You could use these predictions to, for example, subtract the line from the original spectrum:

    mask = ( my_spec.wv > oiii[0,0])*(my_spec.wv < oiii[0,1] )
    my_spec.f[mask] -= my_lmodel(my_spec.wv[mask])

If the parameters of the fit are of interest, you can access then with `my_lmodel.p` (and the covariance matrix, for errors, is stored in `my_lmodel.covar`), but you will have to check the individual functions/methods to see which parameter is which.

* * *
## Reading Data ##

Input from a file is handled with inheritance.  If you know what format your data are in, the following classes know how to read these formats and return fully functioning `Spectrum` objects:

    from mapspec.spectrum import TextSpec, TextSpec_2c, FitsSpec
    
    s1 = TextSpec('mockdata.txt')  #for 3 column format
    s2 = TestSpec_2c('mockdata_2col.txt') #for 2 columns, assumes no errors
    s3 = FitsSpec('mockdata.fits')

`FitsSpec` contains many keywords in order to deal with the vast diversity of .fits formats:

    s3 = FitsSpec('mockdata.fits', extension = 1, data_axis = 1, error_axis = 2,
                  x1key = 'CRVAL1',
                  dxkey = 'CD1_1',
                  p1key = 'CRPIX1'
                  )

Two files with test data from NGC 5548 (3 column ascii) are in `examples` (test.LBT.dat and test.MDM.dat---test.dat is a copy of test.LBT.dat), and 6 spectra for rescaling are in `examples/mapspec_test`

* * *

## Rescaling Spectra ##

The tools for rescaling spectra are in `mapspec.py`.  Most of the work is done by the `RescaleModel` class:

    from mapspec.spectrum import *
    from mapspec.mapspec import RescaleModel
    
    sref = TextSpec('ref.txt')
    lref = EmissionLine(sref, oiii[0], [ oiii[1], oiii[2] ] )

    my_model = RescaleModel(lref, kernel = 'Gauss')

`my_model` will take an input emission line and try to align it with `lref`.  The model consists of a wavelength shift, rescaling factor, and smoothing---the form of the smoothing kernal is specified by the `kernel` keyword (in the above example, a simple Gaussian).

The parameters of the model are stored in a dictionary, so they are easy to access.  If you know what parameters you want, you can immediate apply the model to the data:

    #shift by 0.25 x-units, multiply by 2, and smooth with kernel of width 1 x-units
    my_model.p = {'shift': 0.25, 'scale': 2.0, 'width': 1.0} 
    sout, lost_pix = my_model.output(my_spec)

`lost_pix` is a boolean array that tells you how much of the original spectrum is lost---you loose at least one pixel on either side for any non-zero shift.  If you don't care about the original wavelength grid, it is suggested to change the wavelengths in place (i.e., `my_spec.wv -= shift`).

Usually, you will want to optimize these parameters so that they match the reference.  To do this, a function `metro_hast` is included:

    from mapspec.mapspec import metro_hast
    chi2, p_best, frac_accept = metro_hast(5000, my_line, my_model)

This will run an MCMC for 5000 steps, and try to optimize `my_model.p` so that `my_line` matches `lref` (as a reminder, `lref` was specified when instantiating `my_model`---any `RescaleModel` object should probably have its own reference line).  `chi2` is the best (minimum) chi^2, `p_best` are the corresponding parameters, and `frac_accept` is the acceptance fraction of the chain.

You then apply the model as above:

    my_model.p = p_best
    sout,lost_pix =  my_model.output(my_spec)

`metro_hast` has some other useful options:

    chi2, p_best, frac_accept, p_chain = metro_hast(5000, my_line, my_model, keep = True)

This will return the MCMC chain of parameters in `p_chain`.  `p_chain` is actually its own object (`mapspec.mapspec.Chain`), but it is little more than a glorified NxM array that knows how to plot itself (it also stores the log-likelihood for each set of parameters in a separate attribute). Also

    plt.ion()
    chi2, p_best, frac_accept, p_chain = metro_hast(5000, my_line, my_model, plot = True)

will plot the MCMC chain as it runs.

## Warning on Interpolation ##

At the moment, only linear interpolation supports a rigorous error propagation.  This includes calculating the covariance matrix due to both interpolation and smoothing when rescaling the data.

Other interpolation methods are supported---any 'kind' keyword for `scipy.interpolate.interp1d` can be used.  There is also an implementation of bsplines using `scipy.interpolate`, and a custom built sinc interpolator (with a Lanczos window by default).

These alternative methods do not support full error propagation.  For now, they will perform the same operation as called for on the flux spectrum, but on the *square* of the error spectrum (i.e., the variance).  This usually results in errors similar to the input and roughly preserves the fractional uncertainty.  However, we note that this is not strictly correct, and may be a feature that we improve in the future.

## Calculation of the Likelihood and Fitting Procedure##

`mapspec` aligns the data and the model by minimzing: (data - model)^2/error^2, where data is the input line, model is the reference value chosen at instantization, and error^2 = (reference error)^2 + (data error)^2.  In other words, `mapspec` takes a maximum likelihood approach, assuming normally distributed residuals and independent uncertainties on the data and reference.

Because of wavelength shifts and edge-effects from convolution, there can be problems aligning the edges of the fitting region---in order to censor these points, it would be necessary to change the amount of data, and therefore the number of degrees-of-freedom, during the fit.  To prevent this while mitigating the edge-effects, `mapspec` ignores 10% of the data (5% on each end) when calculating the likelihood.  Although this is not an optimal solution, it does produces reasonable results and appears to be a good compromise between correctness, simplicity,  and practicability.

It is therefore suggested to choose the fitting region (line wavelengths) slightly larger than would naively be expected for isolating the emission line flux.  It is also suggested to remove large shifts (greater than 1 pixel) before performing the fit.  A convenience function `mapspec.mapspec.get_cc` is provided to cross correlate two spectra---see `do_map.py` for an example.

In the Bayesian framework, priors are always added into the likelihood calculation.  `mapspec` assumes uniform priors on all parameters, so the priors do not explicitly enter into the calculation of the log-likelihood.  Note that a flat prior *is informative* for the case of the scaling parameter---however, because the rescaling is a factor of a few (not many orders of magnitude), this situation makes little difference.

When using a Gauss-Hermite Kernel, h3 and h4 are constrained to be > -0.3 and < 0.3; experimentation shows that this range is sufficient to produce a wide range of emission line shapes.  The finite interval is enforced by setting the prior probability to 0 outside of this interval.  Similarly, strange behavior will occur if the kernel width drops below the spectral resolution (a kind of undersampling/aliasing effect).  A minimum kernel width is imposed at 1/2 of the wavelength spacing of the reference data.

`RescaleModel` objects have the option to add priors, either through a function provided by the user or from posterior distributions stored in `Chain` objects.  See `do_map.py` for an example.
